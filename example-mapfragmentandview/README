When embedding EMP3 Map in your application you have four options as stated below:

SampleMapFragment   : Use MapFragment object statically (xml layout)
SampleMapFragmentPgm: Use MapFragment object dynamically (programatically)
SampleMapView       : Use MapView object statically (xml layout)
SampleMapViewPgm    : Use MapView object dynamically (programatically)

Files you will be interested in for each of the aabove projects are:
layout file, MainActivity.java and build.gradle file.

The build.gradle files in each of the projects uses different techniques for compile time and run-time resolution of EMP3 SDK.
These options are described in the confluence article referred to in the README file in the parent folder.

Each of the Sample application allows you to execute a set of basic tests. These are NOT all-inclusive regorous tests. Code for
the tests is in the Common project. Intent of the tests is to show basic use of EMP3 API to display features on the map(s).
